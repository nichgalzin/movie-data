# Movie data
Movie date project for FAC application

## About this project
This site was built with HTML, css and vanilla js. Beside it being a practice piece for the accumulation of the learning
I have been doing so far, I also wanted it to be aesthetically pleasing and usable. To achieve this I utilized lots of built in 
methods for both object and array manipulation.

## Some Highlights

```Object.keys()``` A handy method that converts all the keys of the object to and array.
<br>
```Object.values()``` Similar to the above but with all the values of a given object.
<br>
```.forEach()``` An a compact array method for iterating through and array.
<br>
```.map()``` An array method that loops through an array and has its output as a new array.
<br>
```.split()``` & ```join()``` Great methods for working with splitting up and re-joining strings. 

## Things to improve
I definitely relied heavily on my comfort with arrays and their methods for this project. As a future challenge I would like to refactor
the project and incorporate more direct ways of working with object data. Such as ```for...in``` loops etc. 

## Images
I found this amazing set of hand drawn posters By artist Natalie Andrewson. I thought they perfectly fit the style and colours I had in mind.

<br>
Better yet use one of their other posters to add to the movie wall of the site!
